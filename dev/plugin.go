   locally in the agent's sandbox (nothing on the control plane).

2. Enable it in the agent's ACCESS.md:
   - system: dev scope: exec,processes,agent

3. If the agent is to install packages or load a browser, release the
   necessary hosts via the egress templates (npm, PyPI, Go, …).

Note: processes started with start live until the end of the agent's waking
phase — they are terminated when the sandbox goes to sleep.

On the agent action (sub-agent in the project checkout): it starts a second
runtime run INSIDE the checked-out project so that the project's own Claude
Code harness applies there (CLAUDE.md, .claude/agents, skills, commands). The
sub-agent runs hermetically — no action proxy, hence no access to GitLab,
email or other target systems; commit and communication stay with the
commissioning agent. Its cost counts against the same budget, its events are
in the same recording (marked as a sub-run). Anyone who does not want this
forbids the action centrally via a guard-rail on the subject dev:agent.`,

func (System) PromptDoc() string {
	return `Available dev actions — your sandbox is your own machine, everything here runs locally in it:
   agent {"cwd":"<the path from the checkout result>","task":"<assignment>","max_turns":60} —
   hands the actual PROGRAMMING WORK to a sub-agent that starts INSIDE the project checkout.
   That is the most important difference from everything else here: only there do the project's rules
   apply — its CLAUDE.md, its .claude/agents (e.g. separate frontend/backend specialists), skills and
   commands. You yourself work in the home and see none of it; that is why you do not piece the code
   together yourself but commission the sub-agent.
   The assignment is a HANDOVER to a colleague without your context — write into it: what is broken
   or is to be built, how to reproduce it, the acceptance criteria, known locations
   (file:line) and the conditions (minimally invasive, run the tests, add a test). No "see above".
   The sub-agent can read, change, build and test — it reaches NEITHER GitLab NOR email and cannot
   commit. Checking in and all communication stay with you.
   One assignment per checkout: while a sub-agent is working there, a second call with the same
   cwd is refused — wait for the report, otherwise two runs overwrite each other's files.
   The result: {"result":"<report: cause, change, verification>","changed_files":[…],"deleted":[…],
   "cost_usd":…,"turns_exhausted":true|false,"error":"<only if the run failed>"}. The file lists
   go into the commit action unchanged; they name the ENTIRE state against the checkout — including
   the work of an earlier assignment on the same task, not only that of the last one.
   CHECK "error": it stands IN the result, the call itself still counts as successful (status ok).
   If it is set, the sub-run failed — then do not commit but read the error and either
   commission it again or escalate in the issue with what you know.
   With "turns_exhausted":true the assignment was too big: close off with the partial result and file
   the rest with covey/create_task instead of trying again in the same run.
   exec {"cmd":"npm test","cwd":"subfolder (optional, relative to your home)","timeout_secs":120} —
   runs a shell command and returns exit_code + output (the last output, truncated). For builds,
   tests, installations; an exit code other than 0 comes back as the result, read the output.
   start {"name":"app","cmd":"npm run dev","cwd":"..."} — starts a LONG-RUNNING process in the
   background (a dev server, a database, a headless browser); it keeps running while you perform other
   actions. logs {"name":"app","tail_lines":100} shows its last output, list {} all processes
   with their status, stop {"name":"app"} ends the whole process group (SIGTERM, SIGKILL after 5s).
   A JOB OUTLIVES YOUR RUN. exec breaks off after at most 15 minutes — anything longer (a full test
   suite, a long build) belongs in start, and there is a second reason for that: output and exit code
   of a started job are recorded in your home. Should your run end before the job does — at the turn
   limit, say — the NEXT run reads the outcome with logs {"name":"…"}, even after a sandbox restart.
   Such an answer carries "from_earlier_run":true and, in "exit", either the exit code or the note that
   the job did not outlive its sandbox. So take the FIRST step of a run over an unfinished job to be
   list {} — never start a suite a second time whose result is already lying there. Choose a name that
   still says something in the next run ("suite-mr1685", not "test1"): the record belongs to the name,
   and a new start under the same name overwrites its predecessor's log.
   The typical procedure for really seeing a web app run instead of only reading its code:
   1. Install the dependencies: exec {"cmd":"npm install"} (or pip/go — the package registries
      have to be released in the egress).
   2. Bring the app up: start {"name":"app","cmd":"npm run dev"} and check with logs whether it is listening.
   3. Test against it: exec {"cmd":"curl -s http://localhost:PORT/..."} — or with a headless
      browser, e.g. start {"name":"chrome","cmd":"chromium --headless=new --remote-debugging-port=9222 --no-sandbox"}
      and then drive it through the DevTools protocol or a Playwright/Puppeteer you installed yourself.
   4. Also LOOK at the app, do not only curl it — a screenshot with headless Chrome/Chromium:
      exec {"cmd":"chromium --headless=new --disable-gpu --screenshot=shot.png --window-size=1280,900 http://localhost:PORT/"}
      (the binary name varies: chromium, google-chrome or the full path — check with exec what is there).
      The PNG then lies in your home: open it with your read tool — you can see images and thereby
      recognise layout errors, empty pages or error messages in the UI yourself.
   5. Pull findings from logs, at the end stop everything you started.
   The PROCESSES only live until the end of your waking phase — the platform clears them away when you
   fall asleep; start a dev server anew in a new waking phase instead of relying on an old one. What
   survives is the RECORD of a job: its log and its exit code stay readable with logs/list.`
