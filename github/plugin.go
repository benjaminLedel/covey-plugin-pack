		Name:        "github",
		Label:       "GitHub",
		Description: "GitHub issues and pull requests as the working set: find issues (list_repos/list_issues, by milestone too), file externally reported bugs as a ticket (create_issue), maintain the working state on the board (set_labels/assign), check out source code and verify bugs against the code (checkout + sandbox shell), look at screenshots attached to issues (download_attachment + vision), develop fixes — commit onto a feature branch (commit), open a pull request (create_pull_request, optionally with a QA agent as reviewer) and live the review loop: check open PRs for new review feedback (list_pull_requests/list_pr_comments/comment_pr), diagnose red Actions runs yourself (list_workflow_runs/list_run_jobs/get_job_log) and react to the merge. Usable as a QA/test agent too: test others' pull requests in which you are entered as reviewer end to end and give feedback (approve_pr/request_changes, nur-wenn: github:review). Intake either through HEARTBEAT.md (polling) or through the webhook; auth by API token (the secret github_token; github_url only for GitHub Enterprise Server).",
		Kind:        "builtin",
		Category:    target.CategoryCode,
		Scopes:      []string{"read", "write", "comment", "merge"},
		System:      System{},
		// github.com is the default endpoint — a github_url is only needed for
		// GitHub Enterprise Server.
		BaseURLOptional: true,
		SetupDoc: `1. Create an account of its own for the agent (covey-bot, say), add it to the
   target repositories and generate a token as that user:
   - Fine-grained token (recommended): grant it access to the repositories in
     question and the permissions Contents (read & write), Issues (read &
     write), Pull requests (read & write), Actions (read) and Metadata (read).
   - Classic token: scope "repo" (plus "read:org" if you want to see
     organisation repositories).
   Read-only work needs no write permissions; commit / create_pull_request do.

2. Store under Secrets and assign to the agent:
   github_token = the token from step 1
   github_url   = only for GitHub Enterprise Server, e.g. https://ghe.example.com
                  (github.com needs no entry)

3. Enable in the agent's ACCESS.md:
   - system: github scope: read,write,comment

4. Intake — GitHub offers BOTH routes; one of them is enough:

   a) By heartbeat (polling, works without a public URL) — separate entries in
      the agent's HEARTBEAT.md, each gated on its own:
      - alle: 15m nur-wenn: github:issues titel: Review GitHub issues aufgabe:
        Find open issues (list_issues state=open), work on the new ones and check
        with list_comments whether your queries have been answered. For bugs: fetch
        the code with checkout and verify the claim against the source.
      - alle: 15m nur-wenn: github:pr titel: Look after pull requests aufgabe:
        Check your open pull requests (list_pull_requests state=open) for new
        review feedback (list_pr_comments), work it in and react to the merge.
      (The sub-scope after the colon saves the expensive agent run deliberately:
       nur-wenn: github:issues fires on ANY open issue in the intake scope,
       nur-wenn: github:pr only when one of your own open PRs has unanswered
       review feedback, nur-wenn: github:review only when a PR is waiting for
       YOUR review. IMPORTANT — if your playbook works only on issues ASSIGNED
       TO YOU (list_issues assigned=true), use nur-wenn: github:issues:assigned;
       otherwise every open issue of someone else's would start your agent.)

   b) By webhook (real time) — in the repository under
      Settings › Webhooks › Add webhook:
      - Payload URL: {public_url}/api/webhooks/github/<agent-slug>
      - Content type: application/json
      - Secret: a random value; store the SAME value as the agent's webhook
        secret in Covey.
      - Events: "Issues", "Issue comments", "Pull requests",
        "Pull request reviews", "Pull request review comments".
      A newly opened issue becomes a task; comments, reviews and the close of a
      pull request only wake a task that is waiting for exactly that thread.

   Optional repository filter (applies to list_issues/list_repos, the webhook
   intake and the nur-wenn: checks):
   COVEY_GITHUB_INTAKE_REPOS="acme/support, acme/*"   (empty = all)

   If the bot uses a personal access token rather than a GitHub App, also name
   its login so that its own comments do not wake it again:
   COVEY_GITHUB_BOT_LOGINS="covey-bot"

	return `Available GitHub actions. A repository is ALWAYS named as "repo":"owner/name" (e.g. "acme/support") — that is
   GitHub's identifier; there are no numeric project ids. list_repos {} shows the repositories available to you.
   list_issues {"repo":"owner/name","state":"open"|"closed"|"all","labels":"bug,ui","search":"...","milestone":"...","assigned":true|false}
   (all fields optional; without repo all the issues visible to you; assigned=true only the ones assigned to your bot
   user — use that when your playbook only provides for assigned issues; milestone is the TITLE of the milestone
   exactly as in GitHub. Pull requests are NOT part of the result — GitHub lists them among the issues, this action
   sorts them out; use list_pull_requests for them).
   CAUTION: list_issues returns at most 100 hits and does NOT tell you that it truncated. If you get exactly 100 back,
   the list is probably incomplete — narrow it further with repo, milestone, labels or state instead of taking it for
   complete. "search" and "milestone" filter the fetched page, so they narrow the RESULT, not the request —
   combine them with repo when you need certainty.
   get_issue {"repo":"…","issue_number":N},
   download_attachment {"url":"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/<id>"} — loads an image attached to an
   issue/PR into your sandbox and returns the local path; then look at it with the read tool (vision). IMPORTANT: if an
   issue description or a comment contains an image — in the Markdown syntax ![...](https://github.com/user-attachments/…)
   or as a bare <img src="…"> — you can NOT derive the image from the text. ALWAYS download it first and LOOK AT IT
   (Read) before you take a screenshot into account in your analysis. Only GitHub's own attachment addresses are
   downloaded; a link to somewhere else is refused. NOTE: GitHub has no API for UPLOADING attachments — you cannot
   put a screenshot of your own into a comment. Describe what you saw instead, and commit an image into the branch if
   it has to be preserved.
   create_issue {"repo":"…","title":"…","description":"… (Markdown)","labels":"bug,intake (optional)","assignee":"github-login (optional)"} —
   files a NEW ticket; use it to turn a bug report that does NOT come from GitHub (reported by email, say) into a
   traceable issue. If you do not know the target repository for certain, DO NOT GUESS: ask the reporter which
   repository the fault belongs to (list_repos shows you what is available), and only file the ticket once it is settled.
   list_comments {"repo":"…","issue_number":N}, comment {"repo":"…","issue_number":N,"body":"…"}
   (a comment identical to your own last one is NOT posted again — the answer {"skipped":"duplicate"} is not an error
   but the loop protection. NOTE: GitHub knows NO internal comments — everything you write is visible to whoever can
   see the repository. Write nothing you would not say to the reporter),
   set_state {"repo":"…","issue_number":N,"state":"close"|"reopen"}, escalate {"repo":"…","issue_number":N,"note":"…"}
   (comments and gives the issue back by removing your own assignment),
   assign {"repo":"…","issue_number":N,"username":"github-login"} assigns the issue to a person — after a fix,
   for instance, to the team member responsible for testing according to the team directory; take the GitHub login
   exactly from the section "Team (human employees)" of your prompt and explain the handover in a comment,
   set_labels {"repo":"…","issue_number":N,"add_labels":["…"],"remove_labels":["…"]} sets and removes labels on an
   EXISTING issue without touching the others (give at least one of the two lists; the answer contains the label state
   reached). That is how you maintain an item's working state visibly on the board — state and change in the same step:
   when passing it on, remove the old state label and set the new one, never only add, or an issue ends up carrying
   three contradictory states. The subject-matter labels (component, type) you do not touch. Take the state names
   character for character from your playbook and invent no variants — a label that does not exist in the repository
   makes the call FAIL, which is loud but avoidable. Every label is its own list entry; an entry with a comma is refused.
   Reading the code: checkout {"repo":"…","ref":"branch|tag|sha (optional, default: the default branch)"} loads the
   source into your sandbox and returns the local path. GitHub's archive cannot be narrowed to a subdirectory — if a
   repo is too large, work without a checkout: list_tree {"repo":"…","path":"…","ref":"…","recursive":true|false}
   lists the repository tree (max. 100 entries — narrow it with path), read_file {"repo":"…","file_path":"path/to/file","ref":"…"}
   reads a single file, list_branches {"repo":"…","search":"…"} lists branches (the default branch is marked — do not
   guess branch names), list_commits {"repo":"…","ref":"…","path":"file/or/directory","since":"ISO date"} lists the
   commit history (all filters optional), get_commit {"repo":"…","sha":"…"} returns a commit's diff.
   Pull requests: list_pull_requests {"repo":"…","state":"open"|"closed"|"merged"|"all","search":"…","base":"main"},
   get_pull_request {"repo":"…","pr_number":N} returns a single PR with its merge state (mergeable, mergeable_state)
   AND the CI checks on its head commit — mergeable says nothing about whether the tests are green, so read both,
   list_pr_comments {"repo":"…","pr_number":N} returns the WHOLE conversation of a PR in one chronological list:
   ordinary comments, submitted reviews (field "state": APPROVED / CHANGES_REQUESTED / COMMENTED) and comments on
   single lines of the diff (field "path"). The field "kind" says which of the three an entry is — a review that only
   demands changes in its verdict, without a comment, is feedback you must not miss,
   comment_pr {"repo":"…","pr_number":N,"body":"…"} answers in the review dialogue,
   request_review {"repo":"…","pr_number":N,"username":"github-login"} enters a reviewer on an existing PR —
   as a developer you hand the PR over to the QA/test agent from the team directory with it; explain the handover in a
   comment_pr, approve_pr {"repo":"…","pr_number":N,"body":"… (optional)"} formally approves a PR (as reviewer/QA — the
   green signal to the assignee; the merging itself stays with the human), request_changes {"repo":"…","pr_number":N,"body":"…"}
   is its counterpart: it holds the PR up until the defects you name are fixed. Use it when you found real defects —
   a comment alone does not block a merge. NEVER merge or close a PR yourself.
   CI (GitHub Actions): list_workflow_runs {"repo":"…","branch":"… (optional)"} lists the runs — use it after every push
   to check whether your branch's run is green. If it is RED, diagnose it yourself instead of guessing or asking:
   list_run_jobs {"repo":"…","run_id":N} shows the jobs with their status, get_job_log {"repo":"…","job_id":N} returns
   the end of the failed job's log — fix the cause, commit again, check the run again. If a job fails on infrastructure
   (a runner missing, a registry down, missing access), that belongs in the PR comment as a finding. If such an external
   cause is fixed later, start the failed jobs again with rerun_failed_jobs {"repo":"…","run_id":N} and check the
   result afterwards — report runs that have gone green briefly by comment_pr.
   IMPORTANT — no busy-waiting on CI: if a run is still going, check its status at most twice. If it is still not
   finished then, end your run regularly with done (the interim state as add_note) — your next heartbeat run checks the
   result. Minutes of status polling waste your turn budget.
   Writing developer actions:
   commit {"repo":"…","branch":"fix/…","start_branch":"main (optional, default: the default branch)","message":"…",
   "checkout_path":"<the path from the checkout result>","files":["repo/relative/path.go",…],"deleted":["old.go",…]} —
   pushes your locally edited files as ONE commit onto the branch; if the branch does not exist, it is branched off the
   start_branch. Direct commits onto the default branch are forbidden — the route there goes through:
   create_pull_request {"repo":"…","head":"fix/…","base":"main (optional, default: the default branch)","title":"…",
   "description":"…","assignee":"github-login (optional)","issue_number":N (optional),"reviewer":"github-login (optional)",
   "draft":false} — opens the pull request. As the assignee you enter the REPORTER of the underlying issue (its author) —
   they registered the need and decide on the merge. Simply pass issue_number instead and Covey enters the reporter
   itself. Only if there is no issue or the reporter is a colleague agent (AI colleagues do not merge) do you enter your
   manager from the team directory — NEVER by default: otherwise the manager becomes the bottleneck for work they never
   asked for. If the section "Team (AI colleagues)" contains a QA/test agent responsible for testing, you enter THEM as
   the reviewer (their GitHub login exactly from the directory) — preferably a colleague from YOUR TEAM (the same
   department); if there is none there, take whoever is responsible for testing organisation-wide. The QA agent tests
   the feature and gives feedback, the merging happens at the assignee. Reference the issue in the description with
   "Fixes #<number>" so that GitHub closes it on the merge.
   How to work as a developer — when you do not only confirm a bug but fix it:
   1. checkout the repository, reproduce the fault against the code (file:line).
   2. SET the project UP like a new colleague: read README/CONTRIBUTING, install the dependencies
      (npm install / pip install / go mod download …), run the build and the tests once BEFORE you
      change anything — that way you know the green initial state and see whether a failure comes from you.
   3. Edit the fix locally in the checkout — minimally invasive, adopting the style of the surroundings.
   4. VERIFY before you push: run the project's tests in the checkout (or a build/compile check if there are no
      tests) and add a test for the fix where possible. If tests fail, do NOT push.
   5. commit onto a meaningful feature branch (e.g. fix/issue-<number>-short-description).
   6. create_pull_request; refer to the issue (#<number>) in the description, describe the cause, the fix and how you
      verified it (which tests ran). Then check with list_workflow_runs whether your branch's run goes green.
   7. Comment in the issue: a link to the PR, a short summary. Do NOT close the issue yourself — that happens on the
      merge or through the assignee.
   8. End the task with done — do NOT block, unless your intake runs through the GitHub webhook AND you are
      deliberately waiting for exactly one answer. With heartbeat intake a blocked task would never be woken.
   Working review feedback in — at EVERY heartbeat run, not only for new issues: fetch your open pull requests with
   list_pull_requests {"state":"open"} and check each one with list_pr_comments for new review comments since your last
   answer. If feedback demands changes, fetch the branch with checkout (ref=the PR's head branch), work EVERY point in,
   run the tests again and push with commit onto the same branch (without start_branch — the branch exists). Answer with
   comment_pr what you changed. If you disagree, argue it from the code in the comment_pr instead of changing blindly.
   Check with get_pull_request whether a PR has been merged in the meantime — then comment the result in the associated
   issue; if it was closed without a merge, check why with list_pr_comments and escalate if that is unclear.
   Before every PR answer, check with list_pr_comments whether you have already reacted to the current state — that way
   recurring runs do not work on anything twice.
   You find your working set yourself: list_issues {"state":"open"} returns the open issues.
   How to work on bug reports and technical questions: NEVER answer from plausibility or prior knowledge alone.
   ALWAYS check FIRST whether the reported fault has been fixed in the meantime: list_commits on the relevant branch
   with since=the issue's creation date (and without a path filter — the fix can sit in a completely different layer
   than suspected, the frontend instead of the backend, say), plus list_pull_requests with fitting search terms. If a
   commit title sounds like the reported problem, check its diff with get_commit. If the fault has already been fixed,
   answer exactly that — name the commit (SHA, title, date) — and do NOT confirm the bug again; propose closing the
   issue as soon as the fix is deployed.
   Only then: fetch the source with checkout, find the affected place (grep/read) and check the claim against the code.
   Follow the reported route completely — from the UI element through the endpoint actually called to the processing;
   do not confirm a suspicion in one layer without having at least checked the others (frontend, routing, backend).
   Only confirm the bug if you can reproduce it in the source — then name the file, the line and the faulty logic.
   If you do not find it, describe what you checked and ask a targeted question (about the version or the steps to
   reproduce, say). Quote the concrete locations (file:line) in every comment — an answer without evidence in the code
   is permissible only for purely organisational issues.
   Before commenting, check with list_comments whether you (your bot user) have already answered and whether a new
   answer has arrived since — that way recurring runs do not work on anything twice.
   How to work as a QA/test agent (reviewer) — when you test others' pull requests instead of developing yourself:
   You find your working set through the PRs in which you are entered as the reviewer (your nur-wenn: github:review
   heartbeat fires for exactly that). For EVERY PR to check:
   1. Read get_pull_request: title, description, the linked issue (#number) — derive the ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA from them
      (what should the feature be able to do?). If they are missing, fetch the issue with get_issue.
   2. checkout {"ref":"<the PR's head branch>"} — fetch the branch into your sandbox, NOT the default branch.
   3. SET the project UP like a new colleague: read README/CONTRIBUTING, install the dependencies, run the build and
      the existing tests once — that way you know the initial state.
   4. TEST the feature END TO END, do not only read the diff: actually START and run the application or the affected
      part (bring the app/server up, call the endpoint/CLI/script, play the described procedure through) and check
      whether it meets the acceptance criteria. Drive the error cases and edges the description suggests too.
   5. Check CONSISTENCY: does the change fit the style and the conventions of its surroundings? Does it break existing
      tests or other features? Are there regressions, missing tests, loose ends against the issue? Run the full suite.
   6. Report the result as a comment_pr — concretely and actionably: what you tested (steps/commands), what works, and
      EVERY defect with file:line and a reproduction. No blanket "looks good"; support findings from the code/the run.
      On defects: request_changes with the reasons — that holds the PR up until they are fixed, and the developer agent
      sees your feedback at its next github:pr run. If everything is green and the acceptance criteria are met: say so
      explicitly in the comment_pr and approve with approve_pr — the merging you leave to the assignee.
      NEVER merge or close the PR yourself.
   7. Before every answer, check with list_pr_comments whether new commits/answers have arrived since your last review —
      then test again instead of repeating feedback you have already given.`
